    "### DICOM\n",
    "\n",
    "*Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)* is an internationally agreed standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and related data. This is a bit of a mouthful but, in simple terms, before DICOM, scanners of different brands were often not able to talk to each other or read files writen by other vendors' equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "DICOM, at least in theory, means we can use readily available software to download image data from other sources, whatever the brand of the system at the other end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, due to the heterogeneity of the healthcare environment, the burden of supporting a huge range of legacy medical equipment, and some historical mistakes, the DICOM standard is incredibly complicated and different interpretations of the standard are common. Fortunately, you don't need to understand all of DICOM to be able to use parts of it effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this high level guide is to introduce the user with some knowlege of networking, Linux, and Python but new to DICOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "A *network protocol* defines how two computers (in this case, medical devices) communicate with each other in order to achieve specific tasks. The DICOM network protocol is a separate entity to the DICOM file type: this point can result in confusion for new users. The DICOM file format is separate and defines how medical imaging studies are stored on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PACS\n",
    "\n",
    "A *picture archiving and communication system (PACS)* is the system medical healthcare professionals use to store and review medical images (including MRI, CT, X-ray, photos, etc). The term encompasses the server (storage) and the client (viewing) softare. In slightly confusing DICOM terminology, server and client are referred to as *service class provider (SCP)* and *service class user (SCU)* respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Client software\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple software libraries and tools that are compliant with the DICOM standard and are able to talk DICOM and handle DICOM files, both commercial and open source.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools allow you to connect to another DICOM-compliant medical device (in our case, the PACS image archive) to perform a task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [DCMTK](https://dcmtk.org/)\n",
    "* [GDCM](http://gdcm.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)\n",
    "* [pynetdicom](https://pydicom.github.io/pynetdicom/stable/)\n",
    "\n",
    "DCMTK and GDCM are freely available (including in the standard Debian/Ubuntu software repositories). DCMTK, developed by the German company OFFIS, is very mature. C/C++ libraries and command line DICOM applications (including Windows binaries) can be downloaded from the [OFFIS website](https://dcmtk.org/dcmtk.php.en). The man pages for DCMTK are well-written and extensive but many of the options are rarely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "DCMTK command line examples will be followed by longer *pynetdicom* equivalents. Pynetdicom available in the [pypi repository](https://pypi.org/project/pynetdicom/) and can be freely installed using pip (as we will see next)."

    "Although DICOM is a ratified standard, it's complexity makes it harder to understand and, perhaps, not as robust as other standards (C and HTTP). There are many different interpretations and certain features may not be implemented or are implemented differently. However, openly available DICOM servers are still useful for creating a lab environment (even if differences may become apparent when compared to commercial software).\n",
